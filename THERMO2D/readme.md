The code here presented is an implementation in MATLAB code of the thoery of finite elements in the case of thermal flow problems in 2D. 
It's worth noting here that the analysis of 2D problems has an actual prartical application in all the cases in which heat flow through 
the extremes of the system is low, as in the case of a metal beam heated from under one of its main dimensions.
