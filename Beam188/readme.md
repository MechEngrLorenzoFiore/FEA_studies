The simple problem presented in the previous study is here approached using a much more evolute instrument, Ansys Mechanical APDL. 
The simulation environment can be user through GUI, here is presented the series of instruction in the form of a macro code (.mac extension) 
for better understanding and for quick experimenting with the different parameters.
